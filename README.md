# Hannibal-ADS(Hannibal Air Defense System)
Following our research, we found that all the applications available on the market are very expensive and demanding.
We then propose an application allowing the control of the devices constituting a multimodal platform of monitoring and observation Sol2Air in real time, allowing the administrator to manage the users and to consult and make the follow-up of the data in real time.

## Installation
DAMS is the software component of the HABBIBAL air defense system. Simply launch the executable file and follow the instructions to install the software.
For hardware installation, see the HANNIBAL ADS readme file.

## Usage
After installing the software and hardware, launch the software and click on the administration field to define the configuration. The system is now ready for drone detection and tracking. 

## Features
- Detection, identification and tracking of drones 
The system must be able to detect and identify the drones in the field of view of the camera as well as predicting the position and tracking it   
- Neutralization of drones 
The system shall be able to jam the drones detected by the positioner control 
- Visualization of video streams and simulation of events on a map
The system shall be able to estimate the distance and position of the detected UAVs and project these data on a map  
- Hardware configuration
The system must provide graphical interfaces that allow the management of hardware equipment such as camera, positioner, gain etc...   
- Privilege management 
The system must be able to distinguish and classify users and provide services according to these types as administrator, user, observer.
